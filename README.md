# Dollars chat landing page

An old reference to a japanese anime show called "Durarara", this web project is an attempt to replicate the chat app in the show (Again no relation to the show makers, this is a fan made work).

#### What is done:
  * landing page.

#### What needs to be done:
  * responsivness.
  * password (JS function that tests on the password, best if it's encrypted.)
  * the actual chat application with a back-end.

#### Why do you do this even:
  * I like front-end.
  * I like Durarara.
  * I think those two reasons are enough haha.
